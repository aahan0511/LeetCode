# Intuition
This was a easy no need for skills type of problem where you just have to return the answer.

# Approach
We just return `x**n` which puts `x` to the power `n`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: `O(1)` | *Beats 100.00%*
- Space complexity: `O(1)` | *Beats 50.21%*

# Code
```Python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        return x**n
```
