# LeetCode

These are my LeetCode solutions, which I have solved. The solutions are organized by problem number.

There are two files in each problem folder:
- `main.py`: The main solution file.
- `detail.md`: A detailed explanation of the solution, corresponding to the LeetCode Solution I wrote.

## PIP Packages

Some repositories may need some packages to run the code, the packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
