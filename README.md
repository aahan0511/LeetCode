# LeetCode

These are my LeetCode solutions, which I have solved. The solutions are organized by problem number.

There are two files in each problem folder:
- `main`: The main solution file.
- `detail.md`: A detailed explanation of the solution, corresponding to the LeetCode Solution I wrote.

## PIP Packages

Some repositories may need some packages to run the code, the packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file for each question's subfolder. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or you can use `uv`:
```bash
uv sync --group <QUESTION_NUMBER>
```

Put the question number after group. For example if you want to install the requirements for Q2877, you can do either of the following:
```bash
uv sync --group 2877
```
```bash
cd source/2877. Create a DataFrame from List
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
